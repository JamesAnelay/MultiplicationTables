The basic point was to try and write my own mocks, I never really got on with mocking frameworks or enjoyed using them the post [here](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/05/10/WhenToMock.html) by Robert C. Martin is a good explanation as to why.

So this was an attempt to rewrite what was a quite mocking-framework heavy test (as is frequenty seen in Magento) into a simpler, nicer to write and importantly FAST test.
